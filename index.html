            I'm a sophomore studying math and computer science at New York University. Ever since I was in elementary school, I've loved 
            trying to solve challenging puzzles and riddles. To this day, I've held onto this deep passion of mine as I'm always trying 
            to solve problems.  Math is the language in which my mind is most fluent in, and programming has allowed me to take my ideas 
            and make them a reality. I'm currently a Quantitative Analyst for the NYU chapter of Paragon National Group, a student-run hedge fund.
